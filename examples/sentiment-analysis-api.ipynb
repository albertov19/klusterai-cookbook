    "In this notebook, we’ll walk you through how to apply the <a href=\"https://kluster.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">kluster.ai</a> Batch API to analyze the sentiment of text data. For illustration, we’ll use a sample from the Amazon musical instrument reviews dataset to determine the sentiment of each review. While we’ve included a sample dataset, you can easily customize this example to work with your own data and specific use case. This technique allows for efficient processing of datasets, whether small or large, with results neatly categorized using a cutting-edge language model.\n",

    "To begin, just enter your API key and run the preloaded cells to start the analysis. If you don’t have an API key, you can sign up for free <a href=\"https://platform.kluster.ai/signup\" target=\"_blank\">on our platform</a>."
